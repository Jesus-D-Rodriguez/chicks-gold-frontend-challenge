This project is a front-end application designed to match the provided design. It simulates a static interface without any API connection.

The application was developed using ReactTS. This technology was selected to best showcase my skills and to fulfill the challenge requirements.

All styling in this application is achieved with pure CSS. No CSS frameworks (such as Bootstrap or Material UI) are used, demonstrating my ability to style the application using fundamental web technologies.
