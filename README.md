# Front-End Application Challenge

This project is a front-end application designed to match a provided mock design. It simulates a static interface without any API connection. The purpose of the challenge is to showcase the ability to create a responsive and visually consistent application using fundamental web technologies.

The application was developed using **React with TypeScript** (ReactTS). This technology was chosen to demonstrate my skills with modern JavaScript frameworks while fulfilling the challenge's requirements.

All styling in this application is achieved using **pure CSS**, without the use of any CSS frameworks (such as Bootstrap or Material UI). This demonstrates my ability to style the application using fundamental web technologies.

- **Node.js**
